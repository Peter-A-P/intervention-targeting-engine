# Where each estimator breaks

The useful half of a comparison. This file accumulates as estimators land; it is complete
at week 6 (PLAN.md section 6). Every claim here has a number behind it from
`results/*.json`, produced by `itx benchmark`.

Estimators in the table so far: S-learner. Baselines: outcome ranking, random targeting.

## S-learner

One model on the features plus a treatment indicator, predicted twice with the indicator
on and off.

**Where it breaks: the treatment indicator is one column among many.** A regularised tree
ensemble splits on whatever reduces loss most, and a treatment effect is usually small
next to the variation the other covariates explain. When the model declines to split on
the indicator, both predictions come from the same leaf, the difference is exactly zero,
and the estimator returns "no effect for anyone" without erroring.

This is not hypothetical. With `min_child_samples=100`, a value chosen as merely cautious
for Hillstrom's 25,000 training rows, the S-learner on IHDP's 448 training rows:

| min_child_samples | Splits on the treatment | Mean predicted uplift | PEHE |
|---|---|---|---|
| 100 | 0.0% | 0.000 | 4.187 |
| 40 | 3.9% | 4.259 | 0.507 |
| 20 (the default) | 2.0% | 4.242 | 0.554 |
| 5 | 1.4% | 4.121 | 0.548 |

The true average effect is 4.016. A PEHE of 4.187 at the top of that table is exactly the
PEHE of predicting zero for everybody, because that is what the model did.

Two consequences, both now in the code. `BaseUpliftEstimator` raises a
`DegenerateFitWarning` when a fitted estimator predicts zero uplift for every unit, so the
failure is loud instead of silent. And `min_child_samples` belongs in the per-dataset
validation grid rather than in a constant: one leaf-size setting cannot serve a 747-unit
dataset and a 64,000-unit one.

**Even when it works, it barely looks.** On Hillstrom the fitted S-learner uses the
treatment indicator in 4.7% of its splits. It recovers the average effect well (mean
predicted uplift 0.0452 against a sample ATE of 0.0454) and ranks usefully, but the
mechanism is a model that mostly ignores the variable the question is about. That is the
argument for the T-learner, which cannot ignore it because it fits the arms separately.

**What it is good at.** Recovering the average effect, and being simple enough that when
it fails the reason is visible. On the synthetic sets it recovers a known constant effect
of 1.0 to within 0.1 and ranks a known heterogeneous effect at a rank correlation above
0.6.

## Outcome ranking, the baseline that is supposed to lose

Not an estimator. A plain model of the outcome, ignoring the treatment, with its predicted
outcome used as a targeting score. It is here because it is what most targeting in the
wild actually does, and because it is the thing a Qini curve is worst at exposing.

**On Hillstrom it is indistinguishable from random.** Qini 0.0011, interval
(-0.0010, 0.0031), against the averaged random baseline's -0.0000. Uplift inside the top
20% is 0.0621 against random targeting's 0.0451 and the S-learner's 0.0866. So a targeting
programme run this way, on a dataset where a real effect exists and is findable, would
have bought most of what random targeting buys and reported a healthy response rate for it.

**On IHDP it is worse than random, and the Qini says it is the best.** This is the finding
worth the whole file. On the first seed:

| Ranking | Qini | Normalised AUUC | Uplift at 10% | Uplift at 20% | PEHE |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| S-learner | -0.0004 | 0.914 | 4.75 | 4.82 | 0.554 |
| Outcome ranking | **+0.0269** | 0.719 | 0.05 | 1.80 | not applicable |
| Random targeting | -0.0012 | 0.825 | 3.69 | 3.72 | not applicable |

Seed 11, test split, 150 units. The outcome ranking has the highest Qini coefficient of the
three and the lowest realised uplift at every budget, far below random: its top 10% of the
population buys 0.05 against random targeting's 3.69, on a true average effect of about 4.
A reader who picked the model with the best curve would pick the one that buys nothing.
`docs/figures/qini-ihdp.png` is the picture of it.

Two things are going on and both matter.

1. **A Qini coefficient is only identified when assignment is random.** The Qini curve
   rescales the control arm's outcomes to the size of the treated group in the prefix,
   which assumes the two arms are exchangeable. IHDP's treated units were thinned on
   purpose, so they are not, and the curve is measuring confounding as much as targeting.
   The Qini column for IHDP is reported because suppressing it would hide this, but it is
   not comparable to the Qini column for Hillstrom, and it is not the metric to read
   there. PEHE is.
2. **The curve rewards ranking on the outcome even when assignment is random**, because
   sorting the treated responders towards the front lifts the curve whether or not the
   treatment caused their response. That is the trap the project is built around, and it
   is why realised policy value at a budget, not the curve, is the headline number.

**Why it gets no PEHE.** Its scores are predicted outcomes, on the outcome's scale, not
effects. Running them through PEHE produces a large number that reads like a bad error
score and is really a units mismatch. The benchmark leaves those cells empty
(`estimates_effect = False`) rather than printing something meaningless.

## Random targeting

The floor. Reported as the average of 200 random rankings rather than one draw, because a
single random ranking is one sample from a wide distribution: on Hillstrom, individual
draws land anywhere in a Qini range of roughly ±0.002, which is half the size of the
S-learner's entire advantage. A model whose interval overlaps this one has not been shown
to beat a coin.

Its uplift at any budget is the population average treatment effect, by construction, and
the test suite asserts that. That makes it the right reference for the uplift-at-k
columns, where zero is not the null: targeting at random still buys the ATE.

## Still to come

T, X, DR and R learners (weeks 2 and 3), Dragonnet (week 6), causal forest if the schedule
allows. Approaches considered and left as literature rather than code, per PLAN.md section
2: TARNet, CEVAE, and the class-transformation method.
